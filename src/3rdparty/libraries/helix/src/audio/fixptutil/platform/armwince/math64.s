; * Notes on APCS (ARM procedure call standard):
; *  - first four arguments are in r0-r3
; *  - additional argumets are pushed onto stack in reverse order
; *  - return value goes in r0
; *  - routines can overwrite r0-r3, r12 without saving
; *  - other registers must be preserved with stm/ldm commands
